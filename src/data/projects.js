      overview:
        "TicketSage is a full-stack movie booking system built with Django REST Framework (backend) and Next.js (frontend). It integrates with the TMDB API to fetch movie data, allows users to browse listings, select seats, and book tickets, while providing an admin dashboard for cinema and booking management. My main role focused on building the backend architecture, APIs, and booking logic.",

- **Django + Django REST Framework** powering RESTful APIs for movies, users, bookings, and payments.
- **TMDB API integration** for real-time movie data.
- **Auto Scheduling:** Custom Django management commands to refresh movie lists and generate showtimes automatically.
- **Authentication:** Secure sign-up/login with dj-rest-auth, token-based authentication, and CSRF protection.
- **Database:** SQLite for development, with models for movies, cinemas, showtimes, and bookings.
- **Deployment:** Backend hosted on PythonAnywhere, frontend deployed on Vercel.`,

- **Admin Tools:** Manage cinemas, movies, showtimes, users, and bookings from a secure dashboard.
- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js and Zustand for state management; communicates with Django APIs.
- **Security:** Enforced HTTPS, password hashing, and token-based authentication.
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, and UAT all passed successfully.
- **Results:** Smooth booking process; user feedback praised ease of use but highlighted improvements needed in seat availability visibility and faster load times.`,
