### Architecture & Core Features

The system follows **Clean Architecture** with strict separation of concerns:

- **Core Domain** â†’ Entities like \`TripSchedule\`, \`Seat\`, \`Booking\`, \`Transaction\`.  
- **Application Layer** â†’ Use cases (\`TripScheduleUseCase\`, \`BookingUseCase\`), DTOs, AutoMapper.  
- **Infrastructure Layer** â†’ MySQL persistence & repository implementations.  
- **Presentation Layer** â†’ ASP.NET Web API controllers with Swagger docs.  
  
#### Core Capabilities:
- Trip management (routes, stops, schedules).  
- Real-time seat availability (STD, BUS, VIP).  
- Booking flow: seat assignment, contacts, order time.  
- Transactions with booking linkage, metadata & status.  
- Passwordless login with OTP (email/SMS).

### My Contributions

- **OTP Authentication:** Designed and implemented passwordless login/register via OTP for frictionless onboarding.  
- **Stop Logic Refactor:** Decoupled stop retrieval from repositories, moving mapping to service layer â†’ easier to test & extend.  
- **Booking Enhancements:** Built the \`TripBooking\` model, added merging logic, and conflict prevention in seat allocation.  
- **Transactions:** Implemented persistence (\`transactionId\`, \`bookingId\`, \`refId\`, status) and ensured reconciliation with bookings.  

#### Impact:
- Simplified user onboarding with OTP.  
- Improved maintainability of schedule & stop logic.  
- Prevented overlapping seat bookings â†’ improved reliability.  
- Scalable due to persistence abstraction & clean separation.
